        <p class="heading-2 pt-10">What is dietary recall?</p>
        <p class="subheading-2-main">
          A traditional dietary recall is a method of dietary assessment
          involving a face-to-face interview conducted by specifically trained
          personnel. During the interview, an individual is asked to recall all
          of the food and drink they had the previous day. Often the interviewer
          will follow the multiple pass recall (MPR) approach, which consists of
          a free and uninterrupted recall of yesterday’s food intake, followed
          by probes for frequently forgotten foods, detailed questions to about
          the exact type and amount of each food consumed and finally a review
          to check for any forgotten items. This method has been considered a
          gold-standard and has been the method of dietary assessment used in
          the US Department of Agriculture’s national nutrition surveys since
          2011.
        </p>
        <p class="subheading-2">
          A single 24-hour recall is not considered to be representative of an
          individual’s usual diet, due to day-to-day variation in food intake2.
          Repeated 24-hour recalls can be used to assess habitual intake. Holmes
          et al, recommend four 24-hour recalls to gather enough information for
          it to be representative. In another Australian study however, eight
          repeat 24-hour recalls were recommended to capture the variation in
          macro-nutrient intake3.
        </p>
        <p class="subheading-2">
          Given the necessity for multiple recalls, there is a large cost
          associated with data collection using the face-to-face recall method,
          in terms of travel and researcher time, for the interviews themselves
          and data coding, entry and analysis.
        </p>
        <p class="subheading-2-last">
          A number of studies have shown that online recall systems are able to
          produce accuracy comparable to the traditional face-to-face
          interview4-8, while being much less costly to support. In addition,
          the need for a face-to-face interview may be a barrier to some
          participants therefore it is possible that online data collection may
          help to achieve a more representative sample.

          <li>
            Reduced burden on participants as they do not need to commit to

        Designed using an evidence-based iterative process
      </p>
      <p class="subheading-2-main">
        Intake24 was developed by computer scientists specialising in
        human-computer interaction. The systematic development of online dietary
        recall systems, particularly with regards to user experience (UX) and
        evaluation is rarely reported, however, user evaluation is a fundamental
        part of the design and development process1. It is important to receive
        feedback, particularly from the intended end users.
      </p>
      <p class="subheading-3-last">
        The development of Intake24 followed an iterative process of four cycles
        of user testing. Specific techniques were used to maximise feedback from
        intended users, which are well established in the technology development
        community. These included; think aloud, eye tracking and an industry
        standard System Usability Scale2. Interviewer-led 24 h recalls were
        conducted at each round of user testing following completion of the
        online recall. These helped to identify food and drink items forgotten
        during the online recall but that the researcher could elicit during the
        interview, and informed the development of targeted prompts.

        <h3 style="color: #ee672d">Think Aloud</h3>
        <p class="subheading-3-last" style="padding-top: 20px">
          During completion of the online recall, the participants were
          encouraged to ‘think aloud’3, giving a running commentary whilst using
          the program. They were asked to say what they thought the system
          wanted them to do at each different stage and to comment on what
          worked well within the system and what didn’t. Two researchers were
          present at all times to observe the participants, take notes, and
          re-establish the flow of dialogue when the participant lapsed into
          silence.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="learn-main-image">

        <h3 style="color: #ee672d">Eye tracking</h3>
        <p class="subheading-3-last" style="padding-top: 20px">
          Eye tracking is the process of measuring where someone is looking. It
          reveals which parts of the on-screen image attract the eye and the
          order in which the user tries to locate the relevant user interface
          objects.
        </p>
        <p class="subheading-3-last" style="padding-top: 20px">
          The eye movements around the screen can help identify areas of the
          system interface that are confusing for the participant. For instance,
          repeated eye movements from one user interface object to another (such
          as re-reading labels or instructions multiple times) can indicate that
          the user is confused and unsure as to what they are expected to do
          next; rapid ‘panicked’ movements all over the screen indicate that the
          user is completely lost and cannot locate the relevant user interface
          elements.

        <h3 style="color: #ee672d">Interview and System Usability Scale</h3>
        <p class="subheading-3-last" style="padding-top: 20px">
          At each round of user testing, users were asked a series of questions
          following completion of the online system. All users were asked ‘How
          did you find the system overall?’ and ‘Are there parts you
          liked/disliked in particular?’ The remaining questions were bespoke
          questions developed by the researchers through observation and the
          think aloud activity. The users were asked to provide more detail and
          possible suggestions for improvement on those tasks they found
          burdensome and comment on aspects of the system they liked or
          disliked. The interviews also included an industry standard System
          Usability Scale questionnaire2 in which the users rated 10 separate
          statements relating to the system on a scale of 1–5, strongly disagree
          to strongly agree, respectively; for example, ‘I think I would need
          help using this system’. There was also space for further comments.
        </p>
        <p class="subheading-3-last" style="padding-top: 20px">
          The testing resulted in a number of key refinements to the system. For
          example, users expressed confusion when each part of the recall
          navigated to a new landing page, this resulted in a ‘flat interface’
          being introduced, which uses only a single interface screen shared
          between all of the recall stages (e.g., quick list, matching foods to
          the database and portion size estimation). The left-hand side (called
          the navigation panel) always shows the current state of the survey;
          that is the list of meals and foods currently entered by the user and
          whether they have been matched to food composition and portion size
          data. This makes it easy to see the overall progress and also allows
          the user to focus on any element.
        </p>
        <p class="subheading-3-last" style="padding-top: 20px">
          The rationale for having a pre-defined meal list was to give structure
          to the recall and facilitate users in remembering the foods and drinks
          they consumed throughout the day. Our usability studies indicated that
          people preferred the pre-defined meal list rather than an unstructured
          or simple ‘time of day’ style structure and were more likely to
          remember what they consumed.
        </p>
        <p class="subheading-3-last" style="padding-top: 20px">
          The introduction of the flat interface resulted in the average time
          taken to complete the online recall greatly being reduced from 22 min
          to 13 min across the four stages of development and the agreement with
          the interviewer led recall improved.
        </p>
        <p class="subheading-3-last" style="padding-top: 20px">
          The final system scored highly on the System Usability Scale with
          83/100 which is rated as excellent.

          The food portion images were developed following the recommendations
          of Nelson and Haraldsdóttir1 and with input from Michael Nelson and
          experts in perception psychology. The foods to photograph were
          prioritised based on the top 100 foods in terms of weight consumed,
          frequency and contribution to energy intake, as reported in the
          National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) of children and young
          people, collected using the 4-day weighed food diary method2,3. The
          range of weights presented is based on the 5th to the 95th centile of
          the weight of food reported during the NDNS2,3.
        </p>
        <p class="subheading-3-last">
          The range of portion sizes in the system have been checked against the
          range of portion sizes reported in the most recent National Diet and
          Nutrition Survey of adults4 which used weighed food diaries, and the
          portion sizes cover the range consumed by adults in all but a few
          cases.

          <p class="subheading-3-last" style="padding-top: 20px">
            For the majority of the ‘as served’ portion image size series in
            Intake24 there are 7 different portion sizes displayed. The guidance
            on development of food photographs written by Nelson and
            Haraldsdóttir recommends displaying an equal number of food portion
            size images within a food atlas in order to avoid the tendency for
            individuals to select the central image. This was on the
            recommendation of the perception psychologist on the steering group
            for the development of the adult food atlas (personal communication
            with Michael Nelson who was on our project steering group). The
            perception psychologists on our steering group both felt strongly
            that there should be an odd number of images in each series and that
            the mean portion (50th centile) should be displayed. When 7 images
            are displayed on one A4 page they are of sufficient size to allow
            portion size to be estimated with a reasonable degree of precision4.

          <p class="subheading-3-last" style="padding-top: 20px">
            The 7 portions displayed in the images are equal increments on a log
            scale. The decision to present the portion sizes on a log scale was
            made because of evidence from visual perception research which shows
            that sensory systems, including vision, respond in a logarithmic
            fashion to objects in the external world, a phenomenon known as
            Weber’s law5. The just noticeable difference (JND) is the minimum
            detectable difference between two stimuli. Weber’s Law asserts that
            as the magnitude of a stimulus increases, the JND gets bigger. This
            means that for example, the difference between 5g of baked beans and
            30g of baked beans is much more noticeable than the difference
            between 211g and 236g despite there being 25g difference in each
            case.

            The accuracy of the food photographs were pilot tested in a feeding
            study where children (n=200) aged 4 to 11 years were asked to
            estimate the portion size of 22 commonly consumed foods. These foods
            were served to children in school and prepared to be specific
            weights and any food leftover was weighed. The children were found
            to be able to estimate portion size with reasonable accuracy using
            the food photographs, with accuracy and precision increasing with
            age6.

            Further work tested portion size images for the top 100 foods They
            were tested in a relative validation against parent/researcher
            recorded 4 day weighed food diaries with 313 children and their
            parents. For children aged 4 years and over separate interviews were
            completed with both the parent and the child, children aged 11 years
            and over were found to be at least as accurate and precise as their
            parent7. Mean estimates of portion size consumed were within 7% of
            the weight of food recorded in the weighed food diary. Energy intake
            was found to be under-estimated by just 3% on average and intakes of
            protein and fat were under-estimated by 5% on average using the
            photographs, carbohydrate was under-estimated by 2% on average. Wide
            limits of agreement for all nutrients indicate a low precision at
            the individual level.
